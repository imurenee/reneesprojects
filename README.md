üå± *All three projects are console-based, written in Python - Each section uses a simple **menu-driven interface** so you can test functions one by one.*

# 1. Hospital Management System üè•
This project was created as part of my university coursework to demonstrate how **basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** can be used to manage patients, rooms, physicians, and transactions in a hospital environment.

# Features
This program allows you to manage:
- **Patients**: Add, update, display, and delete patient records.
- **Rooms**: Add rooms, update room status, view room info, and delete room data.
- **Physicians**: Add doctors, update their details, and delete physicians.
- **Transactions**: Log payments, update them, or remove them.

# 2. Patient Name List Management üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

A simple console-based program that allows hospital staff to manage a list of patient names.

This project was created as part of my university coursework to demonstrate how **Python lists and basic logic structures** can be used to manage, organize, and analyze text-based data in a user-friendly way.

# Features
This program allows you to:
- **Add Patient Names**: Input names into a running list.
- **Remove Patients by Position**: Delete a patient by selecting their index in the list.
- **Remove Patients by Name**: Search and remove a patient by name value.
- **Display All Patients**: Show the full list of current patients.
- **Search for Patient Position**: Find out where a specific patient is listed.
- **Sort Names**: Display patient names in ascending (A‚ÄìZ) order.
- **Count Patients**: Show the number of names in the system.
- **Analyze Name Lengths**: Display the average number of characters, and the longest and shortest names.

# 3. Blood Pressure Management System ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

A simple console-based program written in Python that allows hospital staff to manage and analyze patient blood pressure readings.

This project was created as part of my university coursework to demonstrate how Python can be used to **collect and perform basic data analysis on numerical input through list manipulation and conditional logic.**

# Features
This program allows you to:
- **Add Blood Pressure Readings**: Input readings into a running list.
- **Remove Readings by Position**: Delete a reading by selecting its index in the list.
- **Remove Readings by Value**: Remove a specific reading value directly.
- **Display All Readings**: Show the complete list of blood pressure values.
- **Calculate Sum and Average**: Display the total and average of all blood pressure readings.
- **Sort Readings**: View the readings in ascending order.
- **Filter Readings Above 120**: View all readings that exceed 120.
